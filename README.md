Have DNA results from Family Tree DNA but need them in ancestry DNA results format? 
This Google Colab notebook converts your X chromosome & Autosomal files into a .txt file with the same format that AncestryDNA provides.
Why do you need it? You can now upload the result file to other DNA information vendors (like tellmegen, nebula, genomelink & more) that aren't necessarily support the format from Family Tree DNA.
